-------- Overall Summary --------
- Several components (`accordion`, `aspect-ratio`, `chart`, `collapsible`, `dialog`, `drawer`, `menubar`, `sheet`, `sonner`, `tooltip`) now include the `"use client"` directive at the top of their files, indicating potential changes in their execution environments.
- Many components have seen adjustments to import order, with `React` often being moved to the top of import lists. This is a non-functional change and does not affect component behavior.
- The import paths for several components and hooks have been updated, reflecting a potential restructuring of the project or migration to a new version (v4).
- Many components have had minor adjustments to the indentation of their `className` props for better code readability. These changes do not affect component functionality or appearance.
- A few components (`Badge`, `card-header`, `NavigationMenuTrigger`, `NavigationMenuLink`, `ScrollAreaPrimitive.Viewport`) have seen CSS class updates, potentially altering their visual appearance.
- No significant user-facing changes, breaking changes, prop updates, or behavior alterations were identified across the majority of component diffs.
